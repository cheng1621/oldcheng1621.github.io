For the following parapragh I just want to take some courseworks as examples.<br /> In a way, I don’t even notice some works I have done is actually using Waterfall methodology.</p><p>For the course about distributed system: <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/schedule.html">Link</a>,<br /> the whole structure is using waterfall methodology, it makes a schedule that what students should do in each day. (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Advantage 2</code>). Actually, it was divided into several phases based on weeks. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Advantage 1</code>. When I firstly see this page, I can realise what I am supposed to learn during this course and there is a clear target in my mind that I know what I can do after taking this course. I think this course is really good for the students who have no knowledge about distributed system.<br /> <img data-proofer-ignore data-src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cheng1621/HelloMike.github.io/master/assets/img/sample/large_scale_engieering_paper1_1.png" alt="Lecture Scedule" /><br /> For the figure above, it defined the scope of the lecture, such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Video</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Preparation</code>. I know what I should do before watching the video, I need to read the paper about GFS first. Actually, it use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">waterfall</code> methodology, since if you don’t read the paper before you go to the video link, you can’t understand the lecture well. (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Advanteage 3</code>) Moreover, it is really easy for everyone to measure their progress, since you know whether you have read the paper or not and whether you understand well about lecture or not. (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Advantage 5</code>).</p><p>For the lab part, there are 4 parts: lab1 to lab4.<br /> The whole lab is to build a key/value storage database and it is divided into 4 labs. the most important thing is that if you do not finish lab1, let’s say there is a bug in lab1. There has to be a problem when you go into lab2 if you do not deal with that problem in lab1, which matches the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">waterfall</code> methodology. Each phase should be reviewed and confirmed before you go into the next phase.(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Advantage 5</code>)</p><p>Each coins have two sides, although everyone can get a lot after taking all the lectures and finishing all the labs, it is really hard to achieve it. Firstly, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Golang</code> is really new language and maybe no students have a experience about it. This course never takes this into consideration. For me, I feel frustrated when I spend 1 week on the golang. (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Disadvantage 2</code>), it has no allowance for uncertainty.<br /> Worsely, only if you write a code without bugs, you can pass all the tests. It means that there is no way for you to find where is the problem. (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Disadvantage 5</code>).</p><p>I think it would be better if this course combines <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Waterfall</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Agile</code> into the course design part.</p><p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Agile</code>:<br /> I can’t think of a specific example which is only use Agile. I just recall a simple part which include <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Agile</code>. In this course, professor opens a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">discussion tabs</code> and asks if the amount of reading is ok for everyone, I think it a part of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Agile</code>.<br /> A popular common example is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Scrum</code>.</p><p>Scrum is a hands-on system consisting of simple interlocking steps and components:</p><blockquote><p>Example: Bill meets with a customer to discuss her company’s needs. Those needs are the product backlog. Bill chooses the most important tasks to work on in the next two weeks. His team meets in a daily scrum to target work for the day ahead and address roadblocks. At the end of the sprint, Bill delivers the work, reviews the backlog, and sets the goal for the next sprint. The cycle repeats until the software is complete.

Both of them are right or resonable for their organizaions. Agile and Waterfall can not only coexist but also play well together.</p><h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion.</h1><p>Although <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Agile</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Waterfall</code> are two different methodologies which apply to the software projects design and developments. The purposes of them is to ensure the end product of high quality.<br /> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Waterfall</code> methodology is mainly used in a situation: the team has specific and straight-forward target, like I need to implement something based on paper, because no customer-involvement is needed in this process.<br /> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Agile</code> methodology is mainly used in a situation: the work has some kind of uncertainty, like the team needs some feedback from customers or leaders.</p><h1 id="reference">Reference.</h1><p>[1] <a href="https://project-management.com/agile-vs-waterfall/">https://project-management.com/agile-vs-waterfall/</a><br /> [2] <a href="https://www.guru99.com/waterfall-vs-agile.html">https://www.guru99.com/waterfall-vs-agile.html</a><br /> [3] <a href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/managing-agile-waterfall-together">https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/managing-agile-waterfall-together</a><br /> [4] <a href="https://stackify.com/agile-methodology/">https://stackify.com/agile-methodology/</a></p></div><div class="post-tail-wrapper text-muted"><div class="post-meta mb-3"> <i class="far fa-folder-open fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href='/categories/large-scale-software-engineering/'>Large Scale Software Engineering</a></div><div class="post-tags"> <i class="fa fa-tags fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href="/tags/large-scale-software-engineering/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >Large Scale Software Engineering</a> <a href="/tags/paper1/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >paper1</a></div><div class="post-tail-bottom d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center mt-3 pt-5 pb-2"><div class="license-wrapper"> This post is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"> CC BY 4.0 </a> by the author.</div><div class="share-wrapper"> <span class="share-label text-muted mr-1">Share</span> <span class="share-icons"> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Waterfall vs Agile - HelloBen&url=https://cheng1621.github.io//posts/LargeScaleEngineering_Paper1/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Twitter"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-twitter"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?title=Waterfall vs Agile - HelloBen&u=https://cheng1621.github.io//posts/LargeScaleEngineering_Paper1/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Facebook"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-facebook-square"></i> </a> <a href="https://telegram.me/share?text=Waterfall vs Agile - HelloBen&url=https://cheng1621.github.io//posts/LargeScaleEngineering_Paper1/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Telegram" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Telegram"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-telegram"></i> </a> <i id="copy-link" class="fa-fw fas fa-link small" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Copy link" title-succeed="Link copied successfully!"> </i> </span></div></div></div></div></div><div id="panel-wrapper" class="col-xl-3 pl-2 text-muted topbar-down"><div class="access"><div id="access-lastmod" class="post"> <span>Recent Update</span><ul class="post-content pl-0 pb-1 ml-1 mt-2"><li><a href="/posts/amazon_leadership/">Amazon bq question</a><li><a href="/posts/OOD_Design/">Design Parking Lot</a><li><a href="/posts/fault-tolerant-system/">6.824 (假设能拿到offer的项目）</a><li><a href="/posts/lowLatency_MultiDatacenter_Databases_Using_Replicated_Commit/">Low-Latency Multi-Datacenter Databases using Replicated Commit Note</a><li><a href="/posts/Frangipani/">frangipani</a></ul></div><div id="access-tags"> <span>Trending Tags</span><div class="d-flex flex-wrap mt-3 mb-1 mr-3"> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/distributed-system/">Distributed System</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/raft/">Raft</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/large-scale-software-engineering/">Large Scale Software Engineering</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/design-pattern/">Design Pattern</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/amazon/">Amazon</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/aurora/">Aurora</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/craq/">CRAQ</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/frangipani/">frangipani</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/gfs/">gfs</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/kvservice/">kvservice</a></div></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-12 col-lg-11 col-xl-8"><div id="post-extend-wrapper" class="pl-1 pr-1 pl-sm-2 pr-sm-2 pl-md-4 pr-md-4"><div id="related-posts" class="mt-5 mb-2 mb-sm-4"><h3 class="pt-2 mt-1 mb-4 ml-1" data-toc-skip>Further Reading</h3><div class="card-deck mb-4"><div class="card"> <a href="/posts/LargeScaleEngineering_paper2/"><div class="card-body"> <span class="timeago small" >Feb 24, 2021<i class="unloaded">2021-02-24T19:10:10+08:00</i> </span><h3 class="pt-0 mt-1 mb-3" data-toc-skip>TiDB & its community</h3><div class="text-muted small"><p> Summary.
