# Why Raft?
Paxos can provide correctness and safety, it is capable of reaching agreement on a single decision. However, it is difficult to understand and it does not provide a good foundation for implementations. (a bad foundation can cause developer waste time on debugging.)

# Goals:
1. understandability.  
    developer can make an extension to algorithm after fully understanding them.
2. 

# Raft consensus algorithm.
1. Raft basics.
