# Introduction.  
a database that shards data across Paxos state machine in data center.  
#### Features. 
1. application can specify constraints to control which datacenter contain which data.  
2. provide externally consistent reads and writes and read at the database at a time-stamp.  

# Implementation.  
### Architecture. 
`universemaster`: a console that displays status information about all zones for interactive debugging.  
`location proxy`: locate the spanservers assigned to serve their data.  
`placement driver`: periodically communicates with spanservers to find the data needs to be moved.
