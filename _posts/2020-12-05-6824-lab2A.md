# Preparation.
* [Raft paper](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/papers/raft-extended.pdf)

# Summary.
There is only one leader in Raft algorithm. Leader remains authority through sending `AppendEntries` to peers.
if one peer doesn't hear from the leader or Candidate, it starts election through sending `RequestVote` to other peers, 
if Candidate gain majority of Votes from peers and it would become leader and send `AppendEntries` to other peers.

# Some details.
1. if there is already one leader in raft, and for some unpredicted reason, `AppendEntries` is failed and other peers does not 
receive that signal, based on Raft algorithm, the peer would become Candidate and start election. If that peer eventually becomes 
Leader and the old leader comes back to work. There is a conflict here. My thought is change the old leader to Follower again through 
`rf.currentTerm`.
2. if more than one Followers change to Candidate at the same time, called **split vote**. Raft use random timeout for different servers. In 
this case, only one candidate could start election eventually through increasing **currentTerm**.
3. test code with `go test -run 2A`. try it with more than 1 time. For me, I try it 10 times to guarantee the code is running successfully 
always.

# Hint:
1. go test -run 2A. Done.
2. focus on 3 things. **RequestVote**, **Rules for servers** and **State** related to leader election.  
* Follower  
Task: update time when receiving signal from Candidates or Leader. If not, becomes Candidates and start election. 
* Candidates  
send `RequestVote` to peers and gain Votes.
* Leader  
Send `AppendEntries` to other peers. Remember to change ole Leader to Follower if there is more than one Leader.
* new to raft

```
type Raft struct {
	mu        sync.Mutex          // Lock to protect shared access to this peer's state
	peers     []*labrpc.ClientEnd // RPC end points of all peers
	persister *Persister          // Object to hold this peer's persisted state
	me        int                 // this peer's index into peers[]
	dead      int32               // set by Kill()

	// Your data here (2A, 2B, 2C).
	// Look at the paper's Figure 2 for a description of what
	// state a Raft server must maintain.
	// (new).
	state int
	Time time.Time
	VoteCount int
	Timeout int
	// (new) end

	currentTerm int
	VoteFor int
	log []LogEntry

	commitIndex int
	lastApplied int
	
	nextIndex []int
	matchIndex []int
}
```
* RequestVote: 
```
type RequestVoteArgs struct {
	// Your data here (2A, 2B).
	Term int
	CandidateId int 
	LastLogIndex int
	LastLogTerm int
}
type RequestVoteReply struct {
	// Your data here (2A).
	Term int
	VoteGranted bool
}
//
func (rf *Raft) RequestVote(args *RequestVoteArgs, reply *RequestVoteReply){
	// Your code here (2A, 2B).
	rf.mu.Lock()
	rf.Time = time.Now()
	rf.mu.Unlock()
	if args.Term < rf.currentTerm {
		reply.VoteGranted = false;
	}
	if rf.VoteFor == -1 || rf.VoteFor == args.CandidateId {
		reply.VoteGranted = true
	}
	if args.Term > rf.currentTerm{
		rf.mu.Lock()
		rf.currentTerm = args.Term
		rf.mu.Unlock()
		rf.convertToFollower()
		DPrintf("%d converts to follower",rf.me)
	}
}
```
* AppendEntries

```
type AppendEntriesArgs struct {
	Term int
	LeaderId int
	PrevLogIndex int
	PrevLogTerm int
	Entries []LogEntry
	LeaderCommit int
}
type AppendEntriesReply struct {
	Term int
	Success bool
}

// (2A) AppendEntries Handler.
func (rf *Raft) AppendEntries(args *AppendEntriesArgs, reply *AppendEntriesReply){
	if args.Term < rf.currentTerm {
		reply.Success = false
	}else{
		rf.convertToFollower()
		reply.Success = true
	}
	rf.Time = time.Now()
}

```

3. Timeout. `rf.Timeout = rand.Intn(150) + 150` range[150,300]
4. Update time. `tf.Time = time.Now()`
