# why Amazon?
Amazon is one of the big tech company nowdays, and I believe working at Amazon is everyone's dream. so am I. Besides of that, there are a lot of talented people in amazon creating amazing products to make people's life easier. This spirit touch me a lot. I am always curious about the new stuff and I also have a great passion to learn something. when I heard about the word "distributed system", I implemented a key/value storage system based on raft. I heard that facebook changed its name to meta, then I try to know what the metauniverse is. and I hope to work with someone who is also curious about everything and has a great passion to learn, and I think we can apply our idea into reality in the future to make the world better. that's why I want to join amazon.

# why I choose this position.
the first and the most important reason is that my experience matched the job description. the second reason that I like to create great services for customers to save their time and money. In my distributed system project, I care about low-latency and performance. When I implemented it. I implemented **snapshot** to improve the performance of log replaying. I divide the whole service into several partition to avoid the situation that one of the server becomes hot spot. I think in aws, there must be many ways to improve performance of the service. and I want to learn more about that. that's what brings me here with this good opportunity.   


# The biggest mistake you made and what did you learn from it? (earn trust, customer obsession.)
