# JOS kernel
I've uploaded all the code about JOS kernel.
* Features.  
`lab2` Mapped virtual address to physical address.  
`lab3` Implemented a protected user-mode environment.  
`lab4` Implemented preemptive multitasking among multiple simultaneously active user-mode environments.  
`lab5` Flesh out kernel and library operating system enough to run a shell on the console.
