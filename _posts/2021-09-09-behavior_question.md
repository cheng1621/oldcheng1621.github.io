# 举例说明，你如何制定了一个很高的目标，并且最终实现了它。
keyword: 很高 + 实现（制定目标的**勇气**和**执行力**）
S: 

## leadership and achieve what you want.
S: Last year, I took a compiler course and I had to group with other two students to do a 40-minute presentation at the end of the semester.  


# customer obsession.
## Tell me about a time you solved a pain point for customers.

## Tell me about a time you made something much simpler for customers

# Ownership interview question --- don't sacrifice long-term goal for short-term results.
Don't say **this is not my job**.  
## tell me about a time you did something at work that wasn't your responsibility.
S: When I was in Schneider, suzhou company, I worked as a programmar in design department. My responsibility is to write different kinds of softwares to deal with some problems using VBA. the situations is that most people in the company is electrical engineering and they don't know much about software. At first, I just need to deal with the problems in design department, but there are some similar problems happen in other departments. 
T: solve the problems in other department.
A: When I finished my own job, I just talked to the manager and workers in other gruop. like what's the requirement of the software, what do you want me to implement? 
R: for me, it's one day job, but for them, they can use it in the future.

## When was the last time that you sacrificed a long term value to complete a short term task?
when I was looking for an internship in China, one question the recruiter usually ask is tell me about the difference between process and thread? for me, it's just a word. Long-term value is to take an operating system course or maybe read a book about operating system(CSAPP) short-term value is to pass the interview. I just google it and read the passage about process and thread, I just need to spend 15mins remembering it in my head and when the recruiter ask about the proglem, I just said it one by one. after the interview, I read the book (CSAPP) twice to get into it in detail. (like why the overhead of switching processes is bigger than switching threads).

# bias for action.
## Tell me about a time you had to change your approach because you were going to miss a deadline.
last semester, I have to take 4 courses and one of the course is about engineering management, it talks about agile method. there are only 4 assignments in the courses. at that time, I checked the assignment and the assignment was about writing something about agile method in 700 words and I had to finish it in two week. at that time, I was like, only 700 words and the due was in two weeks? I could finish it in one day. I just ignored it and continued to do my stuff. Then when I start to do the assignment before the day I need to submit it, I realised the assignment is more than I thought. it required me to read two papers which is bout 10 pages each and then write something about what you learned from that paper. I shocked, I don't know what to do. Finally, I just looked through each paper really quick and remember some key points in my head and start to write my assignment. Of couse, I got a really low score on that assignment. From that experience, I just realised I had to calculated the workload of the assignment carefully and start it ASAP. 

# Tell me about a situation where you had a conflict with someone on your team. What was it about? What did you do? How did they react? What was the outcome?
S: I took a compiler course last semester and one assignment is to do a presentation about some compiler tools. I needed to group with another student, we chose a topic about ANTLR 4 which is used to generate a parser tree. we divied the presentation into two parts, one of us need to do the introduction part which include the history of the antlr4, why is is important. the other one need to look into the tool in detail and introduce how to use antlr4. As a cs student, we both prefer to do the part about how to use the tool than introduce the backgroud of the tool. you know, you may use it in the career future.  
T: get a good score on the presentation and get A at that course.
A: I realised that as a team, the first priority is to get a good score on that presentation. I talked to him like, OK, i could take the part about introduction and something other than how to use ANTLR 4 only if you tried your best to do your part. 
R: finally, we got and A in that course. I realised that in a team, sometimes you can't do what you want to do  and sometimes you need step back and sacrifice for the team. btw, you have to trust your teammate if you decide to do something as a team.

# Give an example of when you saw a peer struggling and decided to step in and help. What was the situation and what actions did you take? What was the outcome?

# Tell me about a time you committed a mistake?
