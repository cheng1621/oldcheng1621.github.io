# Abstract.
Aurora is a service as part of AWS. The bottleneck of the performance is moving from storage, kind of things to network. It was pushing redo processing to a multi-tenant scale-out storage service, purpose-built for Aurora.  

# Introduction. 
since I/Os can be spread across many nodes, each node are longer hot. Network is become the bottleneck of the performance of the whole system.  Aurora leverage the redo log across a highly-distributed cloud environment.  

# Durability at scale
### Replication and Correlated Failures.
quorum-based voting protocol: `read + write > nodes` and `write > nodes / 2`;  
In Aurora, suppose there is 6 nodes and 3 AZ. each AZ has 2 nodes. and each node is the copy of the other one. According to quorum-based voting protocol. one AZ failure is allowed and 3 nodes can failure.  

### Segmented Storage.  
MTTF: mean time to failures, it is hard to reduce the possibility of MTTF.  
MTTR: mean time to repair, instead, Aurora focuses on reducting the possibility of MTTR.  
database is segmented into PGs, and each PG has six 10GB segments, 3 AZs. A large node is required. the Node is provisioned as virtual hosts using EC2.  

### Operational Advantages of Resilience. 
if a system can handle long failures, it definitely handle short failure. No more than 1 PGs can be patched simultaneously.  

# The log is the database.
### the burden of amplified writes.
MySQL: generates many I/Os, result in `additive latencies` and `synchronous stalls`.  
MySQL writes data pages to objects as well as redo log record consisting of two parts. `before` and `after` images.  
### Offloading Redo Processing to Storage.
In Aurora, the only writes across the network is `redo log` instead of the whole object.
crash recovery: the process spread across all normal foreground processing.  
### Storage Service Design Points
In Aurora, the background processing has negative correlation with foreground processing.  
Traditionally, the background processing has positive correlation with foreground processing.  

# the log marches forward.  
show how to keep consistency without expensive redo processing in Aurora.
### Solution sketch: Asynchronous Processing.  
each log record has an associated `Log Sequence Number(LSN)` that is a monotonically increasing value.  
In that case, single segmented read is allowed instead of quorum read.  

### Normal Operation.
VCL: Volume Complete LSN.    
##### Writes.  
A special log LSN is to contrains the database get too far ahead of the whole system. it can't not be greater than the sum of current VDL. (normally 10 million).  
##### Commits
the commits are processing asynchronously.  
##### Reads. 
a page in the buffer cache must always be of the latest version. 
##### Replicas.

### Recovery. 
Traditionally, the database depends on WAL(write-ahead log) to represent the precise content of all committed transactions.  
`checkpoint` log applicator will apply checkpoint log to the relevant database periodically. When in the way fo recovery, the database could roll back to that checkpoint.  

# Putting in all together. 
need to be detailed further.
